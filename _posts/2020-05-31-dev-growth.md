title: Growing as an independent developer
published: false

I've decided that from today onwards, I will work regularly on side projects that will help me grow as a developer. 

I will commit changes to my existing or new repositories - atleast 4 days in a week.

My github contribution heatmap is pretty much dry and I want to change that. 

- Add a monthly visualization.
